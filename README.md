# Django Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Version: 1.0.0
Initialized Project and read through some documentation. Explored the project structure.

Version 1.1.0
Added Login component, non functional at their current state. Installed router vue and configured it.

Version 1.2.0
Downloaded shadcn charts due to lower bundle size and experimented with implementation.

Version 1.3.0
Defined an Auth composable to make the logged in state globally accessible and defined redirects for the router.

Version 1.4.0
Due to time constraints, i have reverted the front end that i had already established. The concept of the login page with all its redirects manually set will eat too much time. I have since implemented a template for the login page and  dashboard page.
